    <p class = 'post-text'>
        In conclusion, my dress code preference revolves around comfort and simplicity. I prefer informal clothes over formal ones, and I try to avoid the itchy and uncomfortable school uniform whenever possible. My limited shopping habits and preference for online purchases contribute to my consistent wardrobe choices. Ultimately, feeling comfortable in what I wear is my top priority in determining my dress code. Thank you for joining me in this discussion!
