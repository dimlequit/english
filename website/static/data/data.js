In this blog, I'll be discussing my fitness and eating habits. I hope you enjoy reading!</p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My fitness</h2> <p class = 'post-text'>First things first, I don't believe I am in good shape. In fact, I am overweight (76 kg) and short (166 cm). Moreover, despite being aware that I have the worst possible shape and that it's important to stay fit, I hardly ever exercise. I am essentially a couch potato. I don't engage in physical activity at all. However, I do have a strong desire to start running or swimming, but I keep procrastinating, using the excuse of not knowing how to begin. I recognize the need to address this issue. My sleeping routine usually involves going to bed at 9 PM and waking up between 5 to 6 AM. However, there are times when I stay up until midnight playing video games or reading light novels, which results in me waking up late the following morning (around 6:30 AM to 7 AM).</p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My eating habits</h2> <p class = 'post-text'>I believe that my eating habits are one of the main reasons for my overweight condition. I am a big fan of fast food and sweets. I eat hamburgers for lunch every day and always have candy in my pocket. The only positive aspect of my eating habits is my love for vegetables. I could eat a ton of vegetables just for one bowl of bún bò huế. However, I dislike bean sprouts and cucumbers. I usually consume one cup of coffee and the same amount of cacao per day. Coffee helps me stay awake during my classes from 1 PM to 4:30 PM, so I drink it at 12 PM. If I drink it in the morning, I feel exhausted by 4 PM. As for the cup of cacao, remember the nighttime gaming or light novel reading I mentioned earlier? I usually have it during that time. That's why my eating habits serve as a prime example of poor choices, such as avoiding seafood, eating four times a day, and consuming excessive amounts of grains. If necessary, I would be willing to improve my eating habits. For instance, I could have three balanced meals a day, increase my intake of seafood, and most importantly, avoid fast food. A single hamburger contains more calories than one needs for an entire day and can contribute to rapid weight gain.</p>
        <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Conclusion</h2> <p class = 'post-text'>In conclusion, I would like to say that you should have a good eating habit to stay in shape, I don’t but you should. Thanks for listening</p>

        "html" : `<section class = 'post-container'> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Introduction</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> Hello, everyone! It's Đinh Phạm Lê Hoàng, and today I'm excited to share my most recent vacation experience with you all. As someone who hardly ever goes on vacation, this trip was a rare and delightful escape from my daily routine. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>About my vacation</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> Last year, I embarked on a special journey with a group of my closest friends to my friend's house in Bình Dương. The place might not be renowned for its tourist attractions, but it holds a special place in our hearts because it's known for its quirky and bizarre charm. </p> <p class = 'post-text'> We set out on the road using the car of the party host's parents, and the journey was filled with laughter and excitement. The trip was short, but we made the most of our half-day stay at my friend's cozy house. </p> <p class = 'post-text'> The weather was hot, but we had planned to spend most of our time by the pool, so it turned out to be a perfect condition for our aquatic adventures. The highlight of the trip was the food prepared by the party host's parents – it was absolutely delicious and filled our tummies with joy. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>About my experience</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> I can confidently say that this was one of the most fun trips I've ever had. What I loved the most about this vacation was the opportunity to chill with my friends, share stories, and create unforgettable memories together. The peaceful ambiance of the place added to the charm, making it a truly relaxing experience. </p> <p class = 'post-text'> Throughout the day, we enjoyed various activities, from splashing around in the pool to playing games and indulging in our favorite junk food. The laughter and camaraderie made every moment special, and I couldn't have asked for a better time with my friends. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Conclusions</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> In conclusion, my recent vacation to my friend's house in Bình Dương was a magical experience that I'll cherish forever. Despite its simplicity and lack of mainstream tourist attractions, the trip was a heartwarming adventure filled with joy and laughter. The opportunity to spend quality time with my closest friends made it truly special, and I can't wait to visit that peaceful place again to relive those precious moments. Thank you for reading, and until next time! </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Conclusion</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> In conclusion, my dress code preference revolves around comfort and simplicity. I prefer informal clothes over formal ones, and I try to avoid the itchy and uncomfortable school uniform whenever possible. My limited shopping habits and preference for online purchases contribute to my consistent wardrobe choices. Ultimately, feeling comfortable in what I wear is my top priority in determining my dress code. Thank you for joining me in this discussion! </p> </section>`

        "html" : `<section class = 'post-container'> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Introduction</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> Greetings, everyone! Đinh Phạm Lê Hoàng here. In this blog, I'll be discussing my personal dress code. I hope you enjoy reading! </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My personal dresscode</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> Firstly, I feel like I lack knowledge of fashion. I don't really have any favorite type of clothes, but if I have to pick, I would say I like to wear something as simple as possible, like a basic T-shirt, a simple pair of trousers, and sandals, etc. Not because they fit me, but because they make me feel comfortable. I only wear formal clothes occasionally, like today, because I have a presentation at school. Speaking of school, in my opinion, we should wear something comfortable so we can focus on studying. The same goes for the cinema; we just shouldn't wear anything too offensive or against the rules of the place. But at a wedding party, we generally have to dress a bit more formally depending on the party host. As for formal clothes, as I mentioned before, I am not a big fan of them, in fact, I'm the biggest anti-fan of them. They make me feel itchy and also make me sweat. That's why I love informal clothes; they are suitable for almost everywhere if you have enough knowledge, and they mostly won't make you uncomfortable. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My shopping habbits</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> Secondly, I am not a shopaholic, so I hardly ever go shopping for clothes. I only do it twice a year, and all of them are purchased online because I don't want to go outside. 90% of the clothes in my closet were bought by my mom, but I mostly wear what I buy on my own. That's why you can see me wearing the same clothes day by day, month by month, or even year by year. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My school uniform</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> And you know what else we wear year after year? That's right, the school uniform. Our school uniform is just a simple orange polo with the school's logo on the left chest. To be honest, it's very itchy and uncomfortable, so I don't like it and avoid wearing it as much as possible. Luckily, in my school, we only have to wear it every Monday, so it's not a big deal. The last thing I want to talk about is whether you can wear shorts in Vietnamese schools. Mostly no, it depends on the school, but still mostly no. I guess we can wear shorts in my school only on Saturdays. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Conclusion</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> In conclusion, my dress code preference revolves around comfort and simplicity. I prefer informal clothes over formal ones, and I try to avoid the itchy and uncomfortable school uniform whenever possible. My limited shopping habits and preference for online purchases contribute to my consistent wardrobe choices. Ultimately, feeling comfortable in what I wear is my top priority in determining my dress code. Thank you for joining me in this discussion! </p> </section>`

In this blog, I'll be discussing my favorite means of transportation and my travel plan. I hope you enjoy reading!</p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My favorite means of transportation.</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> While I don't usually go outside, if I had to choose, I would go for an electric scooter, something like Vinfast's motorbike. The reason I like it is that I wouldn't have to worry about fuel, although I understand that electricity bills are still a concern. Nevertheless, that's always been something to worry about. Currently, I don't own an electric scooter, but I am considering buying one if the opportunity arises. The limited travel range of an electric scooter doesn't bother me much since I rarely venture far from home. </p> <p class = 'post-text'> For my day-to-day commute to school, I use an electric bike, which is essentially a bicycle powered by electricity. It takes me about 15 minutes to reach my school, and this mode of transport suits me perfectly. Taking the bus is a rarity in my life, with only one instance this year when I used it to go to a mall in District 1. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My travel plan.</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> Typically, I spend my vacations at home, but this time I am going to explore Đà Lạt, a place renowned for its beauty and frequently talked about by many. Since I enjoy being alone, I plan to undertake this journey solo. To keep costs low, I'll opt for a bus as my mode of transportation to Da Lat. I intend to stay there for 2 days and 1 night before heading back. While I haven't finalized my itinerary yet, I'm thinking of seeking suggestions from my friends and exploring activities recommended on the internet. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Conclusion</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> In conclusion, electric scooters and bikes are my preferred means of transportation due to their convenience and eco-friendliness. As for travel plans, I'm excited to step out of my comfort zone and experience Da Lat's attractions. Taking in the scenic beauty while exploring the city promises to be an adventure worth undertaking. That's all, thank you for reading </p> </section>`

In this blog, I'll be discussing my shopping habbits. I hope you enjoy reading!</p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>My shopping habbits</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> I may not be a shopaholic, lacking money and a job at the moment. However, when I do shop, I opt for official shops on the Tiki online platform for their reliable quality. Shopping online is my go-to method as it offers convenience, sparing me from going outside. Despite the risk of uncertain product quality and additional delivery costs, the ease of online shopping outweighs these concerns. From books and electronics to clothes and food, I buy various items online. </p> <p class = 'post-text'> Tiki has earned my trust as their products consistently meet my expectations. Relying on customer reviews and checking the seller's reputation helps me make informed decisions. I find paying via banking or electronic wallet more convenient than using cash. </p> <p class = 'post-text'> Thankfully, my online shopping experiences have been mostly positive, with only one instance of a faulty computer mouse, which I could refund. Sale items don't deter me, as I believe they maintain the same quality as regular-priced products. </p> <p class = 'post-text'> Bargaining is not part of my shopping routine since online shops and convenience stores seldom allow for it. Even if I had the opportunity, I would likely feel too shy to haggle. </p> <h2 class = 'sub-heading'>Conclusion</h2> <p class = 'post-text'> In conclusion, my preference for online shopping, especially on Tiki, stems from its convenience and reliable products. Though I may face occasional challenges, the advantages of this approach make it my favored way of acquiring items, without turning me into a shopaholic. And that's all, thank for reading. </p> </section>"
